<p><strong>Short Biography</strong> Working in <a href="/portfolio#Samsung Techwin">Samsung Techwin</a> for 6 years, I was involved in various projects including IoT camera and cloud camera as a network camera device engineer.
Running <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Deepsight-1780933522021742/">machine learning study group</a> for 3 years with researchers and developers from various fields, I stepped into AI development realm.
After that, I joined <a href="/portfolio#Medipixel">Medipixel</a>, the medical startup, and have lead AI project team developing medical image deep-learning system and reinforcement-learning based surgery robot control system.</p>

<p>Since I opened my eyes to computer development, the art of logic and knowledge, I have been really into “Oriental Philosophy” also. 
Because I think that it describes system beyond system determined by modern philosophies. 
Wittgenstein, one of godfather in modern philosophy, said that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote is connected with starting paragraph of “Tao Te Ching”, one of the greatest oriental philosophy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The way that can be spoken of Is not the constant way<br />
The name that can be named Is not the constant name.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both of them indicate something above the “Language”, system of mankind.
I am fascinated by this sort of paradox, the system beyond system and formless form. 
I use to feel that this can be a clue to get unreachable goals in the present formulaic computer system.</p>

<p>When I was university student, I had a chance to attend presentation session for “Cyber Physical System”. 
The speaker of session told final vision of CPS is that connect all artificial and nature environment in the Earth under one system and control it.
It was really interesting concept that borderless interaction between cyber and real world.</p>

<p>I established big plan from that inspiration. 
To begin with, I needed to find what I have to know. Interaction between cyber and real world was a broad concept. 
I had to prepare a number of knowledge stack. 
I categorized necessaries. 
In my conclusion, IoT, cloud, management network system were the most important domains. 
In addition to that I had to prepare strong development skill set and to elaborate vague concept of “interaction”. 
So, I decided to dive into industrial field making network device.</p>

<p>Samsung Techwin was a best option. 
Because They had developed the network camera that handle video streaming, one of the most heavy data, I was able to deal with realistic problems in the industrial field. 
Over the years in many projects, I achieved network, OS and device control knowledge. 
As I expected, all experiences in Samsung Techwin became strong base for my goal.</p>

<p>But there were still shortage parts. 
Though I comprehended to build some system, I did not have main knowledge of controlling it. 
By chance when I faced machine learning method, I felt the possibility to solve one of my problems.
Since then, I joined machine learning study club. 
And after several years I was able to join medical AI start-up from my colleague’s recommendation. 
In Medipixel through the process that develop judging objects network and making a decision agent, I approached to my goal one step closer.</p>
