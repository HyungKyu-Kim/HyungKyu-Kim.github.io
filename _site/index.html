<p><strong>Short Biography</strong> Working in <a href="/portfolio#Samsung Techwin">Samsung Techwin</a> for 6 years, I was involved in various projects including IoT camera and cloud camera as a network camera device engineer.
Running <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Deepsight-1780933522021742/">machine learning study group</a> for 3 years with researchers and developers from various fields, I stepped into AI development realm.
After that, I joined <a href="/portfolio#Medipixel">Medipixel</a>, the medical startup, and have lead AI project team developing medical image deep-learning system and reinforcement-learning based surgery robot control system.</p>

<p>Since I opened my eyes to computer development, the art of logic and knowledge, I also have been into <strong>“Oriental Philosophy”</strong>
because I believe that it describes system beyond system defined in modern philosophies. 
Wittgenstein, one of godfather in modern philosophy, said that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote is connected with starting paragraph of “Tao Te Ching”, one of the greatest oriental philosophy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The way that can be spoken of Is not the constant way<br />
The name that can be named Is not the constant name.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both of them indicate something transcending the “Language”, system of mankind.
I am fascinated by this paradox, <strong>systemless system</strong> and <strong>formless form</strong>.
In this notion, it means something that cannot be determined as a fixed entity because it changes constantly as nature.
I often feel that this can be a clue to get unprecedented areas in the present formulaic computer system.</p>

<p>When I was in undergraduate, I had a chance to attend presentation session on <strong>“Cyber Physical System”</strong>. 
In the past traditional system, “Human” was the only way to execute task via collected information in cyber world.
But CPS describes a system to manage cyber and physical world by actuators and sensors without human intervention.
The speaker of the session said that final vision of CPS is to connect all artificial and nature environment in the Earth under single integrated system and control it.</p>

<p>I had been seeking a way to graft notion of “formless form” onto computer system.
After coming across CPS, I saw potential to build infinitely evolving autogenous system. 
To build this system, it is necessary to obtain adequate technological background step by step.</p>

<p>First, since this system runs by connecting with heterogeneous devices, backbone technologies including IoT, cloud and network management system are important. 
Thus, I decided to dive into industrial field making network device. 
Because Samsung Techwin develops network camera handling one of the heaviest data, video streaming, I was able to deal with realistic problems in the industrial field. 
Over the years in many projects, I acquired knowledge on network, device communication and embedded system.</p>

<p>Next, I had to get a method to control system. 
In this regard, I stepped into machine learning filed. 
I joined medical AI start-up. 
In Medipixel through the process that develop judging objects network and making a decision agent, I approached to my goal one step closer.</p>
