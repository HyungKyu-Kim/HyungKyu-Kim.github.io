<p><br />
Cardiovascular disease takes up a large portion of annual death around the world. 
<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death">WHO announcement</a> shows that ischaemic heart disease is the world’s biggest killer in 2016 and one of the most general treatments for ischaemic heart disease is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention">Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</a>. 
But <strong>traditional PCI has several shortages</strong> as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Huge gap of proficiency and hard to transfer high level skill</li>
  <li>Exposure to harmful radiation generated from angiography</li>
  <li>Long time(about 1 hour)</li>
</ul>

<p>To overcome these challenges, Medipixel has been collaborating with <a href="http://eng.amc.seoul.kr/gb/lang/main.do">Asan Medical Center</a> to develop <strong>the world first autonomous PCI robot system</strong>. 
This system autonomously navigates guide wire to the target lesion.
It means that this system performs to transfer from atypical procedure depended on personal skill and experience to typical procedure.
This <strong>“Standardization of Procedure”</strong> can take advantages such as</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reduce gap between an expert and a beginner</li>
  <li>Diminish exposing time from radiation</li>
  <li>Enable workers to do other tasks</li>
  <li>Reduce time</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="challenges">Challenges</h5>
<p>For successful PCI procedure, It is necessary to quantify abstract and complex factors, such as doctor’s experience and medical knowledge, as proper numerical values in system. 
Performing this task, we should consider the following issues</p>

        <ul style="vertical-align: middle;">
            <li>
                Coronary arteries is complex environment that involves dynamic status changes like blood flow and heartbeat

<h5 id="required-technologies">Required Technologies</h5>
<p>To undertake complex project, my team prepared various technologies including medicine, robotics and reinforcement learning.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To keep safety, it needed to comprehend medical knowledge for PCI</li>
  <li>To achieve robust control, my team surveyed domains such as Robotics and Elastic Rod</li>
  <li>To ascend accuracy of system, we studied Reinforcement Learning(RL) and Computer Vision Algorithm</li>
</ul>

</figure>

<h6 id="why-is-reinforcement-learning">Why is Reinforcement Learning</h6>
<p>Our environment was so complex that we did not have high confidence for traditional control method from robotics.
Because most of that algorithms were static method, it had shortage to handle dynamic environment.
Therefore, we needed algorithm to approach a goal by interaction with environment.</p>

<figure>

<h5 id="main-tasks">Main Tasks</h5>
<h6 id="planning">Planning</h6>
<p>To solve complex problem, we needed approaches by stages.
Through simplifying problem, we started at the most low dimension.
I planned this project like</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>2D → 3D → 3D with vibration → Animal → Clinical environment</p>
</blockquote>

<h6 id="set-to-work">Set to work</h6>
<p>My role on this project was to lead direction of development as a development team leader.
I divided complicated main subject as sub task to materialize a plan.
I performed below tasks in each stage</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pre-research: I prepared knowledge for building of system</li>
  <li>Set-up: I established all experiments environment</li>
  <li>Design: I designed overall system architecture</li>
  <li>Implementation: I implemented the environment module in RL framework and integrated all modules</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="pre-research">Pre-research</h5>

<h6 id="system-framework">System Framework</h6>
<p>I compared many other architectures of RL control system in real environment.
I researched preexistence system published in conferences including <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8449910">ICRA</a>, <a href="https://www.nema.org/pages/default.aspx">NEMA</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/">Arxiv</a>. 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07067v1">Setting up a Reinforcement Learning Task with a Real-World Robot</a> was one of the most helpful experiment result.</p>

<h6 id="medical-knowledge">Medical Knowledge</h6>
<p>We got many interviews with doctors and researchers who involved with coronary artery disease. 
Also, we had PCI observations several times and studied about coronary arteries. 
In these processes, we obtained knowledge like below</p>
<ul>
  <li>Procedure of PCI</li>
  <li>Case studies by patient</li>
  <li>Usage of equipments</li>
  <li>Terms and Abbreviation</li>
  <li>Procedure time</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="set-up">Set-up</h5>

<h6 id="establishment-of-experiment-plan">Establishment of experiment plan</h6>
<p>First environment was two dimensional blood vessel model.
I selected equipments of system and drew a rough sketch of the experiment environment. 
Final expected environment figures were as below.
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/medipixel/profile_biorobot_2d3denv.png" width="90%" />
    </figure></p>

<h6 id="installation-of-darkroom">Installation of darkroom</h6>
<p>Vision was the most important input data method  of this system.
Since vision is sensitive to the change of illumination problem, I had to exclude natural light from experiment environment and darkroom was the best option to handle this problem. 
I was in charge of purchasing and installing all equipments for the darkroom. 
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/medipixel/profile_biorobot_experiment_env.png" width="90%" />
    </figure></p>

<h6 id="comparison-of-cameras-by-latency">Comparison of cameras by latency</h6>
<p>Latency is one of the most important factors to be considered for system performance. 
As a huge proportion of latency depended on camera, I selected a camera model carefully. 
As seen in the figure below, I conducted latency tests and compared scalability, compatibility, resolution and latency of varied camera model.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/medipixel/profile_biorobot_realsense_test.gif" width="65%" />
</figure>

<h5 id="design-principles">Design Principles</h5>

<h6 id="modularity">Modularity</h6>
<p>Since this system is capable of having diverse environmental conditions like manipulator and external sensor devices, 
I considered about minimizing the number of additional tasks when subsystems or peripherals were changed.
I separated the system into submodules by role and made hierarchy among them.</p>

<h6 id="scalability">Scalability</h6>
<p>As I mentioned above, we planned an environment transition step by step. 
Thus, I had to enable smooth conversion among heterogeneous environments such as 2D, 3D, animal and clinic. 
Also, as we needed repetitive experiments for improving system performance like reward shaping, various settings for experiments had to be managed conveniently.
I achieved this purpose via abstract and inheritance structure.</p>

<h6 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h6>
<p>It was necessary for implemented RL algorithm to be verified based on unit test. 
We used <a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs/#atari">Atari gym</a> environment for test. 
And I considered standard communication protocol connecting with heterogeneously external devices.
For this reason, I designed this system by using de facto standard systems such as <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">openai-gym</a> and <a href="http://www.ros.org/">ROS</a>.</p>

<h5 id="implementation-issues">Implementation Issues</h5>

<h6 id="handling-nonlinearity">Handling nonlinearity</h6>
<p>There were physical errors during manipulation by motor rotation as many general controlling systems under physical world. 
In coronary artery environment, this kind of errors especially had a worse effect because it requires to handle exquisite unit of space and time. 
I approached this problem in a heuristic way and trying define error tolerance thresholds because there is no perfect solution for this issue. 
In trial and error, my team found that using a very small fixed step command(about 0.05mm) guaranteed that guidewire would be less affected by this problem and able to reach a correct position. 
So we decided to use value-based RL algorithm.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/medipixel/profile_biorobot_slip.png" width="90%" />
</figure>

<h6 id="elaborate-data-flow-of-inter-module-communication">Elaborate data flow of inter-module communication</h6>
<p>To set proper shape and size of data, there were several trial and error. 
As shape of data required in each module was different, I pondered on computation cost of reshaping data while a current module was transferring data to next module. 
Also, because RL agent utilized experience replay, limitation of memory size used for replay buffer was a big issue. 
Therefore, size of state in RL had to be defined properly.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/medipixel/profile_biorobot_data.png" width="70%" />
</figure>

<h6 id="synchronization-between-rl-agent-and-manipulator">Synchronization between RL agent and manipulator</h6>
<p>RL agent needs to obtain necessary data at once for decision making in each time step. 
But as a manipulator was operated in asynchronous method, I decided what module should be-waited and collected data from the manipulator for synchronization. 
I implemented communication module and put this module in charge of that task.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/medipixel/profile_biorobot_sync.png" width="70%" />
</figure>

<h6 id="reduction-of-system-latency">Reduction of system latency</h6>
<p>Reactivity of system is one of the most critical factors in overall system performance because agile situation awareness and countermeasure were essential in PCI procedure. 
Thus, it was compulsory to minimize latency on each module because summation of delayed time took a huge proportion of reactivity. 
Especially, total latency largely depends on acquisition time of camera image and vision preprocessing time.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/medipixel/profile_biorobot_latency.png" width="95%" />
</figure>

<h6 id="strict-exception-handling">Strict exception handling</h6>
<p>It was essential to handle and recover errors that cause harmful results strictly because this system was trained in real environment. 
I handled many abnormal situations like twisted guidewire and path deviation by excessive manipulation. 
Also, communication manipulator exception was another serious handling point because it could lead to system procedure to halt.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/medipixel/profile_biorobot_except_twisted.png" width="60%" />
</figure>

<h5 id="experiment">Experiment</h5>

<p>My team implemented and numerous experiments with RL algorithms to improve system performance. 
Main experimental factors are as below</p>

<ul>
  <li>Value based algorithms (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298">Rainbow dqn</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887">C51</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06923">IQN</a>)</li>
  <li>Demonstration algorithms (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03732">Deep Q-learning from Demonstrations</a>)</li>
  <li>Reward Shaping</li>
  <li>Data fusion Execution Timing (Early fusion, Late fusion)</li>
  <li>Additional (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01495">Hindsight Experience Replay</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="further">Further</h5>

<h6 id="possibility-to-transfer-other-domain">Possibility to transfer other domain</h6>

<p>PCI is a  high risky procedure with and requiring high skills. 
Therefore, there is a possibility to apply our skill-set in other domains in a relatively easy way.</p>
