<p>Lung cancer is placed in a top position in cancer death rate. 
In 2015 total 17,399 people was killed by lung cancer in Korea. 
It is fatal in that it takes 27.9% in the total amount of cancer deaths. 
The reason for its high death rate is that efficient inspection process does not exist yet.</p>

<p>In many cases, biopsy is taken to confirm whether a patient has lung cancer or not.
It, however, should be avoided as much as possible since it is an invasive inspection. 
Usually chest computed tomography (CT) is used for biopsy screening, so radiologist’s role of reading CT correctly is very important.</p>

<p>In the light of sharing experience accumulated over time, decision support system based on AI has been widely adopted in various industrial fields. 
In medical domain, the need of quick and precise diagnosis decision is intensifying. 
Hence, this kind of system has been being researched by many scientists and Medipixel’s lung cancer project is designed to fulfill those needs. 
We co-worked with <a href="http://eng.amc.seoul.kr/gb/lang/main.do">Asan Medical Center</a> and ended up developing Lung Cancer Diagnosis Clinical Decision Support System.</p>

<p>It takes the following advantages</p>
<ul>
  <li>Detect nodules that can be missed → increased diagnosis accuracy</li>
  <li>Assist doctors to read chest ct scan at ease → increased diagnosis productivity</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="system-features">System Features</h5>
<p>This system features are below</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support diagnosis process whether nodule is malignant or benign</li>
  <li>Handle non-small cell lung cancer nodule in 10mm~30mm range</li>
  <li>Show the number of nodules and nodule region of interests</li>
  <li>Indicate estimated lung cancer risk percentage</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/medipixel/mp_screen_shot.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<h5 id="tasks">Tasks</h5>
<p>I was involved in this project as a project leader who is in charge of designing overall process and data flow.</p>

<p>I decided to approach this project in practical view. 
Since most of processes in deep learning system are formulaic, I did not exert much effort to design a system structure. 
Making totally new model was excluded from selections as well. Instead, we put more time finding high performance model adopted in medical domain and improving it.</p>

<h5 id="dataset">Dataset</h5>
<p>It is one of the most important issues in deep learning system to gather and handle proper dataset.
We utilized several dataset of hospitals involved with <a href="http://eng.amc.seoul.kr/gb/lang/main.do">Asan Medical Center</a> and open dataset like <a href="https://biometry.nci.nih.gov/cdas/nlst/">NLST</a> to improve performance of the system. 
There were some issues with datasets as follow</p>
<ul>
  <li>Different data format(especially open data-set)</li>
  <li>Different data modality such as resolution of CT</li>
  <li>Overwhelmingly numerous malignant nodules(more than benign nodules)</li>
  <li>Difficulty on finding totally negative data which did not have any nodule</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="preprocess">Preprocess</h6>
<p>We had to preprocess heterogeneous data set through one pipeline.
Basically, it was necessary to reconstruct and normalize from 2d DICOM slices to 3d voxel data. 
Since this task was expected to take a long time, it had to be done in advance, and results must be saved in hard disk before proceed regular training process.
Main process was like below.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Perform 3D reconstruction with thickness of 1mm</li>
  <li>Set Hounsfield Unit between -1200 and 600</li>
  <li>Normalize each pixel value between 0 and 255</li>
</ul>

</figure>

<p>Rather than using the whole voxel data, it was divided into chunks of specific size due to GPU memory limitation. 
This process occurred in training and inference routine.</p>

<h6 id="gathering-dataset">Gathering Dataset</h6>
<p>To improve performance, we needed to obtain more dataset from various source.
This process collecting proper data for model requires long time cost for doctors. 
Especially, data labeling is a big overload because it is generally handcrafted task to segment the region of nodule in pixel by pixel.</p>

<p>we exert much efforts to help them.
Key was an efficiency and decrease  of time consuming. 
We had several meetings with doctors and proposed useful methods such as nodule segmentation support application and semi-auto segmentation for nodule data.</p>

<h5 id="deep-learning-network">Deep Learning Network</h5>
<p>In research period I realized that ensemble strategy was efficient to improve whole system accuracy. 
So, I got many experiments using various models and tried to find optimal combination. 
As a result we decided to use three Deep Neural Network(DNN) networks in the system.</p>

<h6 id="detection-network">Detection-network</h6>
<p>This network detects nodules. 
It is built based on 3d U-net. 
Detection network consists of encoding and decoding network. 
Nodule’s features are extracted in encoding network through 3D residual blocks.</p>

<h6 id="segmentation-network">Segmentation-network</h6>
<p>This network performs segmentation of nodules in each slide based on the results from detection network. 
Its second role is to perform as a filter for false-positive regions.
Our segmentation-network is taking advantage of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02611">Deeplab-v3+</a> network whose network structure is shown in figure below</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/medipixel/mp_net_segmentation-net.png" width="70%" />

</figure>

<h6 id="classification-network">Classification-network</h6>
<p>Classification-network is responsible for determining the degree of malignancy of candidate nodules. 
Features of nodules are extracted through 3D residual network layer, and we came up with final result through the features.</p>
<figure>

<h5 id="practical-technique">Practical Technique</h5>
<p>I also added a simple preprocess stage before segmentation stage to get rid of nodules in outer body.
This stage was composed of a simple method that just checks the largest contour and eroded it.
It mapped candidate nodule region onto 2D slide and examined whether it belongs to inside of the body, and regions outside of the body were removed as false-positives.
This method had some advantages over other methods that perform complicated lung-segmentation as follows</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is much faster than conventional segmentation method via complex algorithm</li>
  <li>It removes an ordinary lung-segmentation algorithm problem that recognizes nodule on the wall as outside the lung</li>
  <li>It solves region segmentation error resulting from different modality such as different CT slide scanner</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="strengths-of-the-structure">Strengths of The Structure</h5>
<p>Generally, most systems in cancer diagnosis has similar structure. 
Among these systems, combinations with U-net based detector and classifier were popular ones. 
<strong>I embedded simple preprocess stage and segmentation network</strong> in center of it. 
Network mapped 3d suspicious chunks to 2d ct slice, at the same time this stage that performed to segment area in suspicious chunks meant scrutinizing and filtering nodules. 
So, I was able to <strong>remove many false positive nodules</strong> from results in first stage. 
From those features, the system got simple but powerful improvement.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Through interviews, we found that time spent on reading chest CT generally takes about from five to twenty minutes.
Our system achieved satisfying results that reduce time to under one minute while maintaining over 90% accuracy.</p>
