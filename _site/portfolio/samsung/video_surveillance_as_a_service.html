  <h1>Video Surveillance as a Service</h1>
  <p>This service integrates cloud system and network camera. 
It can provide necessary information from network camera in the local network to the outside network user while keeping security.</p>

<h4 id="my-role">My Role</h4>
<p>Network camera main developer</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implement module establishing tunneling between server and camera</li>
  <li>Implement controller module between server and camera</li>
  <li>Implement module streaming between server and camera</li>

<p>As we can see from a name, CCTV(Closed Circuit Television) is a device working on closed local network. 
In network camera age, this concept was maintained as past. 
But this tendency had met technology called Cloud Service and started to move forward from closed world to open world.
“Video Surveillance as a Service” was created from this background.
VSaaS has advantages compred with traditional servailance systems.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide efficiency and total cost of ownership</li>
  <li>Provide flexiblity and scalability</li>
  <li>Access to value-added services</li>
  <li>Provide a wide array of products for hosted video</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="stratocast">Stratocast</h5>
<p>I was participated in this domain as device side developer in 2015, when VSaaS was started to provide commercial service.
I started to work this interesting domain from <a href="https://www.genetec.com/">Genetek</a>’s <a href="https://www.genetec.com/solutions/all-products/stratocast/overview">“Stratocast project”</a>.</p>

<h5 id="vsaas-camera">VSaaS Camera</h5>
<p>After that project, I was involved with development of the various client system in Network Camera device.
As each Cloud System had a distinct method to communicate between camera and server, I tried to find <strong>flexible hierarchy</strong> to cope with these different features. 
This point was about <strong>dealing with heterogeneous protocols</strong> with out huge transform.
Main issues were below</p>
<ul>
  <li>Different connection protocol like VPN, SSH and custom protocol(socket)</li>
  <li>Different system structure like existence of delegate connection server and region connection method</li>
</ul>

<p>I also had to handle <strong>variation of the connection network types</strong> like.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ethernet</li>
  <li>LTE</li>
  <li>wifi</li>
</ul>

<p>And <strong>exception handle</strong> was a significant topic. It had issues like following.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compose device rebooting scenario(eg. reconnect)</li>
  <li>Set connection retry count via limitation of server’s resources</li>
  <li>Control amount of sending data by network bandwith</li>
</ul>

<p>Structure of VSaaS camera was below figure. My development part is in red rectangle.</p>

<p>This client provided service through connection with server like following order.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Register Camera: Official operator performs secure process like RSA key exchange and registers camera in server</li>
  <li>Sending Data: Registered camera sends video and additional data to streaming server through established tunnel</li>
  <li>Streaming Service: Authenticated user requests the video streaming matched with user</li>
</ol>
