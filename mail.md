<p>Dear Professor Ruzena Bajcsy<br>
My name is Hyungkyu Kim from South Korea and I am emailing you since I am interested in your doctoral course.<br>
Until now, I have pondered "how" I can develop, but I think that it's time to focus on "what" I develop.<br>
I believe that I am able to break any obstacles that I will face for research with my experience of industrial field over years!<br>
</p>

<p>I would like to briefly introduce my background. My main skill-set is as below</p>
<div class="brief">
  <div class="partial_img">
    <div style="text-align:center">Implementing hybrid system by case</div>

<br>
<p> For many years, I had wanted to train myself through product process in industrial field.<br>
As a result, I acquired integral skills to develop any results that I want.<br>
In SAMSUNG, I worked as Embedded System Engineer over 5 years until I joined Medipixel, 
a medical startup. And In Medipixel, I have done AI Researcher job for 2 years.<br>
Main projects that I have been in charge of are as follows

I dream of creating systems to break boundaries between cyber world and physical world.
I have always contemplated about how I could add value to the real world through information collected and processed in cyber world.
Reading researches and publications in your group, I got fascinated with your marvelous achievements.<br><br>
Your works on connected devices through human centered data gave me valuable insight that how I have to approach real world problems.
In individualized models, I was really impressed that it is possible to materialize meaningful result through analysing human dynamics and extracting data from model.
I have always concerned about topics such as extracting significant data from complex phenomenon like human activities and manipulating realworld through the data.
In this regard, your works would be a big clue for my future.
<br><br>
I believe that in your group, with my experience in industry, I could contribute to the progress of unprecedented works.

I would like to say more in this email, but I know you are very busy.<br>
If I can get a chance, it would be great honor for me to communicate with you regarding getting your exciting experiments and advice.
<br><br>
I know that there is a huge possibility that this mail will not be read, since a number of people are sending mail to you.
But I will never give up to get this chance. 
I am really dreaming of joining your research group.
I am looking forward to your reply.
</p>

<p>
Sincerely yours,<br>

I have huge interest in finding a way to bring out information collected and processed in cyber world to the real world. 
Reading researches and publications in your group, I got fascinated with your marvelous achievements.<br><br>
I have thought that for interaction of true meaning with cyber space, it is necessary for device to possess physically deformable appearance.
"Shape-shifting device" showed the way to me. 
I totally agree that this physical adaptation is the best method for intuitional alive information.<br><br>
The concept of "Ubiquitous Robotics" was fantastic as well. 
Since it is possible to bring out compositive procedure beyond simple information to the physical world, I believe it has tremendous potential to conquer complex problem in future.
With tough environment such as space exploration, even though there are problems such as high latency, high variant and an accident, I think that the mission can be continued by this kind of system.

I dream of creating systems to break boundaries between cyber world and physical world.
I have been searching for a way to bring out information collected and processed in cyber world to the real world.
Reading researches and publications in your group, I got fascinated with your marvelous achievements from tangible bit to radical atom.<br><br>
In my childhood, it was one of my dreams to meet my favorite game character in this real world. 
As the dream in my childhood, even after I started to study computer science, I imagine if it is possible to embody trained and skillful agent like a hero in game and it will lead us to solve many problems in real world.
Your works showed the way to me. In all my career, I have prepared my skill sets and concerned with what I want to do for this kind of works.

Dear Professor Joseph A. Paradiso<br>
My name is Hyungkyu Kim from South Korea and I am emailing you since I am interested to join Responsive Environments group.<br><br>
I dream of creating systems to break boundaries between cyber world and physical world.
I have always contemplated about how I could add value to the real world through information collected and processed in cyber world.
Reading researches and publications in your group, I got fascinated with your marvelous achievements.<br><br>
Your works on connection of the various sensors and environments including artificiality and nature gave me insight of true meaning of connection.
Especially, it was really impressive that projects like TESSERAE show possibility on how to overcome drastic environment through sensor nodes and flexible formation. 
It would be a clue for me to take a step forward to the beyond the connection.
