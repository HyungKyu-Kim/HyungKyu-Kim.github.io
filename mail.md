I have huge interest that the way can bring out information collected and processed in cyber world to the real world.
Reading researches and publications in your group, I was fascinated with your marvelous achievements.
Shape-shifting device was really impressed me in that it can propose display of intuitional alive information.   
And the concept of ubiquitous robotics was fantastic also. 
I think It has tremendous potential to conquer complex environment.  
I believe that In your group, with my experiences in industry,it is possible to move forward to unprecedented work.
