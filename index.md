**Short Biography** While working at [Samsung Techwin](/portfolio#Samsung Techwin) for 5 years, I was involved as a network camera device engineer in various projects including IoT device control and cloud system.
After leading a [machine learning study group](https://www.facebook.com/Deepsight-1780933522021742/) for 3 years with researchers and developers from various fields, I stepped into the AI development realm.
After that, I joined [Medipixel](/portfolio#Medipixel), the medical startup, and have led the AI project team developing a medical image deep-learning system and a reinforcement-learning based surgery robot control system. And now, I join the [Soft Robotics and Bionics Lab](http://softrobotics.snu.ac.kr) as a researcher under Dr. Yong-Lae Park. My team has been developing an automated pipeline to manufacture shape-changing robots.
