**Short Biography** While working at [Samsung Techwin](/portfolio#Samsung Techwin) for 6 years, I was involved as a network camera device engineer in various projects including IoT device control and cloud system.
After leading a [machine learning study group](https://www.facebook.com/Deepsight-1780933522021742/) for 3 years with researchers and developers from various fields, I stepped into the AI development realm.
After that, I joined [Medipixel](/portfolio#Medipixel), the medical startup, and have led the AI project team developing a medical image deep-learning system and a reinforcement-learning based surgery robot control system.

Since I opened my eyes to computer development, the art of logic and knowledge, I also have become interested in "Oriental Philosophy"
because I believe that it describes a system beyond the system defined in modern philosophies. 
Wittgenstein, a godfather in modern philosophy, said that 

> "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent."

This quote is connected with starting paragraph of "Tao Te Ching", one of the greatest oriental philosophies.

>"The way that can be spoken of Is not the constant way  
The name that can be named Is not the constant name."

Both of them indicate something transcending the "Language" system of mankind.
I am fascinated by this paradox-**systemless system** and **formless form**.
In this notion, it means something that cannot be determined as a fixed entity because it changes constantly such as nature.
I often feel that this can be a motivation to get unprecedented areas in the present formulaic computer system.

When I was an undergraduate, I had a chance to attend a presentation session on **"Cyber Physical System"**. 
In the traditional system, "Human" interaction was the only way to execute task via collected information in the cyber world.
However, CPS describes a system to manage the cyber and physical worlds by actuators and sensors without human intervention.
The speaker of the session said that the final vision of CPS is to connect all artificial and natural environments on Earth under a single integrated system and control it.

I had been seeking a way to graft the notion of "formless form" onto a computer system.
After coming across CPS, I saw the potential to build an infinitely evolving autogenous system. 
To build this system, it is necessary to obtain the adequate technological background step-by-step.

First, because this system runs by connecting with heterogeneous devices, backbone technologies including IoT, cloud, and network management system are important. 
Thus, I decided to dive into the industrial field of network device development. 
Because Samsung Techwin develops network cameras which handle some of the heaviest data, video streaming, I was able to deal with realistic problems in the industrial field. 
Over the years, I acquired knowledge on networks, device communication, and embedded systems through many projects. 

Next, I needed a method to control the system. 
So, I stepped into the machine learning filed and joined medical AI start-up. 
At Medipixel, I moved one step closer to my goal through the process of developing a judging objects network and making a decision agent.
