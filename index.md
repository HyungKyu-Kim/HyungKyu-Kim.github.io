**Short Biography** Working in [Samsung Techwin](/portfolio#Samsung Techwin) for 6 years, I was involved in various projects including IoT camera and cloud camera as a network camera device engineer.
Running [machine learning study group](https://www.facebook.com/Deepsight-1780933522021742/) for 3 years with researchers and developers from various fields, I stepped into AI development realm.
After that, I joined [Medipixel](/portfolio#Medipixel), the medical startup, and have lead AI project team developing medical image deep-learning system and reinforcement-learning based surgery robot control system.

Since I opened my eyes to computer development, the art of logic and knowledge, I have been really into **"Oriental Philosophy"** also. 
Because I think that it describes system beyond system determined by modern philosophies. 
Wittgenstein, one of godfather in modern philosophy, said that 

> "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent."

This quote is connected with starting paragraph of "Tao Te Ching", one of the greatest oriental philosophy.

>"The way that can be spoken of Is not the constant way  
The name that can be named Is not the constant name."

Both of them indicate something above the "Language", system of mankind.
I am fascinated by this sort of paradox, the **systemless system** and **formless form**.
In these notion, systemless and formless, it means that something that can not be determined fixed entity because it is changed constantly as nature.
I use to feel that this can be a clue to get unprecedented areas in the present formulaic computer system.

When I was university student, I had a chance to attend presentation session for **"Cyber Physical System"**. 
In past traditional system, "Human" was a only way to execute task via gathered information in cyber world.
But CPS describes system to manage cyber and physical world by actuator and sensors without human intervention.
The speaker of session told final vision of CPS is that connect all artificial and nature environment in the Earth under one system and control it.

After meeting with CPS, I saw potential to build system that evolves infinitely and lives itself. (I had imagined)
To build this huge system, I needed to prepare numerous technological background.

왜 인더스트리얼인가? 프랙티컬한 부분 강조?  
First, since this system runs by connecting with heterogeneous devices, backbone technologies including IoT, cloud and network management system are important. 
Thus, I decided to dive into industrial field making network device. 
Samsung Techwin had developed the network camera that handle video streaming, one of the most heavy data, I was able to deal with realistic problems in the industrial field. 
Over the years in many projects, I achieved network, OS and device control knowledge. 

Next, I had to get method to control system. 
In this regard, I stepped in machine learning filed. 
And after several years I was able to join medical AI start-up from my colleague's recommendation. 
In Medipixel through the process that develop judging objects network and making a decision agent, I approached to my goal one step closer.
